                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                            is a small and
                            lightweight
                            language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                            connected to the
                            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                            and Math, and a core
                            set of
                            language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                            be extended
                            for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="text-justify">
                                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                                browser and its
                                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                                place
                                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                                and page
                                navigation.
                            </li>

                            <li class="text-justify">
                                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                                running JavaScript
                                on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                                with a
                                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                                application, or
                                perform file manipulations on a server.

                            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                            in some others. The
                            JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                            declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                            have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                        <h2>Variables</h2>
                        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                            called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>


                        <p class="text-justify">A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                            dollar sign ($);
                            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through
                            "z" (lowercase).</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                            identifiers. You can also use
                            the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                        </header>
                        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                        <p class="equation">var x = 42.</p>
                        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example</p>
                        </p>
                        <p class="equation">x = 42.</p>
                        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                            shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                        <p class="equation">let y = 13.</p>
                        <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

                        <h2> Variables Scope</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                            global variable, because
                            it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable
                            within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                            function.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                            rather, a variable
                            declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                            within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                            (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                            statement.</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
                        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not

                        <p class="text-justify">Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the
                            window.variable syntax.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                            frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a
                            variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from
                            an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                            variables. If the
                            const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                            variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                        <p class="equation">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                            CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                            }</p>
                        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                            problems.</p>
                        <p class="equation">const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive,
                                    null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and
                                    immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>and Object</li>
                            <p class="text-justify">Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
                                you to perform
                                useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental
                                elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and
                                functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional
                            else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                            Boolean for an
                            explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1
                            is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                            statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                            conditions tested in
                            sequence, as follows:</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                            statement_2;<br>
                            } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
                            which evaluates to true
                            will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ...
                            }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting
                            if statements:</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br>
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
                            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                            expression, because the
                            assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not
                            use the following code:</p>
                        <p class="equation">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
                            practice is to put
                            additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
                        <p class="equation">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
                            condition evaluates to true.
                            A while statement looks as follows:
                        </p>
                        <p class="equation">while (condition) statement</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
                            executing and control passes
                            to the statement following the loop.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                            the condition returns
                            true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns
                            false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>Example:</p>
                        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                        <p class="equation">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x +=n; }</p> <p>With
                                each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take
                                on the following values:</p>
                        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                        <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop
                                terminates.</p> </section> <hr>
